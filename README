Geo-Hashing version 0.01
========================

NAME
    Geo::Hashing - Perl library to calculate Geohashing points

SYNOPSIS
      use Geo::Hashing;
      my $g = new Geo::Hashing(lat => 37, lon => -122, date => "2008-05-24");
      printf "Today's location is at %.6f, %.6f.\n", $g->lat, $g->lon;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows calculating the locaiton of Geohashes as described in
    http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page.

METHODS
  new
    Create a new Geo::Hashing object.

  lat
    Set or get the points latitude. When settings, only the integer portion
    is considered. Set to undef to just get the offset.

  lon
    Set or get the points longitude. When settings, only the integer portion
    is considered. Set to undef to just get the offset.

  date
    Set or get the date used for the calculation. Note that this is the
    actual date of the meetup in question, even when the 30w rule is in
    effect.

  djia
    Set or get the Dow Jones Industrial Average used for the calculation. If
    not set, it will be automatically retrieved depending on the value of
    $self->source.

  source
    Set the source of the DJIA opening data. Will load
    Geo::Hashing::Source::Name and call get_djia($date). See
    Geo::Hashing::Source::Random for a sample.

  use_30w_rule
    Set or get the 30w flag. Will be set automatically if lon is set and is
    greater than -30.

  debug
    Enable or disable diagnostic logging
